Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. The importance of software engineering in the technology industry is that it provides a way to manage the resources, schedule, and budget of the project, and to ensure that the team is working together effectively


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
three key milestones in software Engineering include
development of programming languages, establishment of software Engineering as a discipline, advent of structured programming.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Software development life cycle includes;
Requirements: documenting user needs
Design: creating detailed design of the software architecture
Implementation: writing code and building software according to the design specifications
Testing: carrying outvarious tests to ensure it meets the functional requirements 
Deployment: releasing software to users
Maintenance: providing updates and enhancement of the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile Methodology ha sto do with its flexibility and responding to change while waterfall methodology has to follow  a particular sequence.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer: writes code and implements software
Quality Assurance Engineer: designs and execute tests plans for software quality
Project Manager: oversees planning, execution and delivery of software products.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide suitable tools for writing, debbugging and testing codes example; visual studio
VCS used to track changes to source code and coordinate work among team members example; subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements, tight deadline,technical debt,


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: testing individual modules of the software
Integration Testing: testing the interacts between the components of the software together.
System Testing; testing the entire software as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: testing the software against user requirements and making sure it meetd the user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Promp Engineering has to do with crafting questions or statements to get the best possible response from AI models


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
